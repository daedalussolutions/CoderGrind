Rails 7.1.2

Ruby on Rails 7.1.2 app that allows for a user to register and log their programming
sessions to a database and awards experience points for completing and logging their sessions.

TODO:

- Possibly remove statistics table and add the columns to user model.
- Create a React frontend with animations. (This would be a lot of work)
- Comments/discussion/forum section
- Custom background images/themes (containers can change color, background images can be added)
- User profile pictures
- Add bonus XP for higher streaks
- Hint window (hints for generating more XP)
